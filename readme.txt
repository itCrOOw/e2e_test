To run the test, follow these instructions:

Open the cypress.config.ts file and add the test user credentials under the env object:

 env: {
   testUser: {
     userEmail: '',
     userPassword: ''
   }
 },

Configure userEmail and userPassword values with the actual credentials.

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Cypress project.

Run the command npm install to setup the environment.

Run the command npm test to run the tests headlessly.

Wait for the test results to appear in the terminal or command prompt.

Note: If you want to run the tests in the Cypress Test Runner, instead of headlessly, 
use the command npx cypress open. This will open the Cypress Test Runner where you 
can select and run the tests.
